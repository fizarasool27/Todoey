This is a to-do list app that allows users to create different to-do categories and in each category, they can add the respective list of tasks they have. The users can search for tasks, delete tasks with just one swipe, check-mark the done tasks and consequently uncheck them, all with persisting the data on their devices, which is done using Realm. The app also has a distinct UI which gives a different random color to each category, and as you add new tasks in these categories, the to-do list starts to take a beautiful gradient going from lighter to darker.
